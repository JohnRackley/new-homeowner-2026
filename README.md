# New Homeowner Guide (2026) — Static Site

This folder contains a simple, fast website you can publish with **GitHub Pages**.

## What’s inside
- `index.html` — the page
- `assets/css/styles.css` — styling
- `assets/js/main.js` — tiny script (just updates the footer year)
- `assets/img/` — the 5 images used for the 5 steps

## Publish with GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (example name: `new-homeowner-2026`).
2. Upload everything in this folder to the repository (keep the same structure).
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
4. Under **Build and deployment**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main** (or `master`) and folder: **/ (root)**
5. Save. GitHub will show you your site URL.

## Local preview
Just double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
